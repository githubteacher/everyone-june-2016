Weather
Desert area: Really hot in the summer, and cold in the winter. You can see all the seasons there. Fall: is really nice cause the leaves on the trees turn colors of red, yellow, orange. Winter:it doesn't snow but it hails and the grass freezes to a level where you can glide with your shoes, kind of fun. Fall
